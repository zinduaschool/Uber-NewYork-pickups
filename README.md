# Uber-NewYork-pickups

## Final Capstone for the 30-Day Challenge by [Zindua School](https://zinduaschool.com)

This project contains data on over 4.5 million Uber pickups in New York City from April to September 2014, and 14.3 million more Uber pickups from January to June 2015. Trip-level data on 10 other for-hire vehicle (FHV) companies, as well as aggregated data for 329 FHV companies, is also included. All the files are as they were received on August 3, Sept. 15 and Sept. 22, 2015

### The Data was sourced from a [NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC)](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/home/home.shtml) 


In the folder `uber-trip-data`, there are six files of raw data on Uber pickups in New York City from April to September 2014. The files are separated by month and each has the following columns:

Header | Definition
---|---------
`Date/Time` | The date and time of the Uber pickup
`Lat` | The latitude of the Uber pickup
`Lon` | The longitude of the Uber pickup
`Base` | The [TLC base company](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/industry/base_and_business.shtml) code affiliated with the Uber pickup

Also in the folder is the file `uber-raw-data-janjune-15.csv.zip` The unzipped file has the following columns:

Header | Definition

`Dispatching_base_num` | The [TLC base company](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/industry/base_and_business.shtml) code of the base that dispatched the Uber

`Affiliated_base_num` | The [TLC base company](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/industry/base_and_business.shtml) code affiliated with the Uber pickup

The file `taxi-zone-lookup.csv` shows the taxi `Zone` and `Borough` for each `locationID`

In the folder `other-FHV-data`, there are 10 files of raw data on pickups from 10 for-hire vehicle (FHV) companies. The trip information varies by company, but can include day of trip, time of trip, pickup location, driver's for-hire license number, and vehicle's for-hire license number.

There is also a file `other-FHV-data-jan-aug-2015.csv` containing daily pickup data for 329 FHV companies from January 2015 through August 2015.

The file `Aggregate_FHV_Data.xlsx`, which contains aggregate analysis on taxi and FHV trips, came directly from the TLC.
